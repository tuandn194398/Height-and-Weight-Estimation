# Height-and-Weight-Estimation
Height and Weight and BMI Estimation By Team 4 - Computer Vision

Estimate the height of a person standing in front of a webcam frame using Google's MediaPipe library to detect body landmarks. Calculate the distance between two feet and comparing it with the frame height to determine the appropriate standing position.
Estimate BMI by extracting features from the input image dataset for data preprocessing. Then, train a model using the ResNet-152 network with the input being the dataset of images that have been feature-extracted.
